<h1>Sans doesn't trust Asriel because he's with Chara</h1>
<p>And the reason why Sans was ready to pick a fight with Asriel when he and Chara met is not because eSans recognized him, but because he knows he’s the king and he has the power to fight them back, and he’s not sure whether or not he can trust him. Maybe it’s the look on Asriel’s face as Chara’s speaking: like he doesn’t believe what she’s saying- not that he thinks that Chara isn’t who she says she is, but she is naieve and doesn’t know what she’s talking about. Things aren’t as easy as she says. And as for Sans… he’s ready to fight him because he just doesn’t know him and he’s too close to Chara. It seems like a trick.</p>
<h1>DFpaps can use dark magic but doesnt know it is that demi would recognize it however dragons in legends is a synonym for the devil right? &gt;w&gt; i wouldnt be surprised if they could learn how to use magic</h1>
<p>I originally thought they were only using reg magic for simplicities sake because I was just going to build up their strength overtime with souls (monster souls strength doesn't fade, but it is like adding 1 point to a 99 point meter between each level up.
But i already know Gaster is involved deeply in the plot. e-e orchestrating certain things. He isn't dead. Not trapped in the Void either. But the Core did malfunction and so the underground is for the most part without power unless people manage to create their own energy sources. Like Gaster. But he doesn't like sharing things.
oh my now demi knows some monster like that pff a lot of them asgore~
If Demi could make music

<p>ChroniclerEnigma: I think so Pap and her are evenly matched in this they constantly want to beat the other 
Crossoverdude: oh my god. that demi in the face and he will snap. (not geno snap- just ordinary snap lol)</p>
<h1>Concepts to work out</h1>
<h1>Concept: Reg Demi: souls.</h1>
<p>he can see everyones souls. he could just take them anyway he could but doesnt want to do it at least give his prey a chance to fight back. So merciful. 
omega demi after having gotten used to his form is alot happier and chiller.</p>
<h1>Concept: Demi being a freedom devil</h1>
<p>I want to say this is merely symbolic of Demi wanting to be free from all his burdens.
what would happen if they slay him? Would freedom be gone? he is freedom in general
could he be slain? Will another Freedom Devil take his place?</p>
<h1>Undyne was able to come back even though she should have been dead? dragon soul</h1>
<h1>Stuff just moved out of the way for the moment</h1>
<p>This was a concept for the scene when Teiran went to the Void and what she saw there… but she didn’t stay long before she moved on. I can’t use this scene though because the whole point of why she was brought to the void changed in the first place. She was brought to see Demi. So she wouldn’t have been taken to sit with a bunch of people.
“in silent shock, set her eyes on the dogs, and started to follow, listening to all the sharp”
So this is kind of wrong because this was supposed to end with Teiran being brought to a room with other amalgam infected people. She was supposed to see her dad again, and one other person. 
I mean… if all of the dragondogs are there… why didn’t they split up if they were empty handed? One DragonDog can take care of themselves getting back to the void, right? 
Well… actually… if Teiran were brought to that room and had her dad there with her… then it wouldn’t make as much sense for her to leave him and look for an escape. It would have been more likely that she would have stayed and waited for something to happen. That would be difficult to add in all the writing for that too anyways.
XP bleh. I guess I wouldn’t mind writing it, but I don’t think that’s how it happened. I can’t see it. 
So… the best thing to do at this point would be for the other two dragondogs to be excluded from the scene as her own takes her to the void. That way… it would make more sense.
So exclude the other two dragon dogs…
Add the room made of rock walls and hand made structure
There are lots of people there, but none of them really talk much. They’re either unconscious or unresponsive. 
Add the dragondog leaving the room…
The rooms are rock walls and structures.</p>

<h1>This is just moved out of the way</h1>
<h1>Smoll and Papyrus’s relationship</h1>
<p>Thoughts: When does this come into play? Its just a constant. 
Sans and Papyrus are rivals. 
Papyrus is always training Sans, often randomly, and jump scare. 
Better be prepared for anything at any time.
Sans is weak physically, but his soul is very strong. Papyrus always has to protect Sans. Which makes Sans grumpy and he always tries to prove himself but more than not gets himself into trouble for it.
Thoughts: Why are you learning about plants in a time like this?
Teiran: (scoots to the shelf, scanning titles. Grabs one book after the other.) Botany? This is a lot of survival stuff. Whoa… I’ve never seen these kinds of plants before… (flips pages, pausing to gawk at a few odd things) Whoa that looks dangerous.
Teiran: I’ll just make a note to avoid that. <em>laughs</em> 
Teiran: Oh no. The giant skeletons did. 
??? drew back, horrified: Skeletons?
Thoughts: Yes. He knows what they look like. You know what they look like. 
Teiran: Yeah, these big dogs like things walking on all fours. They were able to pick me up and the other monster holding me in their jaws and carried us up the mountain- to the place with the Blue Flowers.
???: Dogs? <em>she’d relaxed, but held a concerned, serious look</em> You’re saying… dragon dogs?
Teiran: Yeah. But they’ve been keeping quiet- when they aren’t kidnapping, terrorizing and eating people.
Teiran: I guess you’re right. They brought me and two other people to this… really dark place and just dropped us off without doing anything to us.
Thoughts: YOU WISH.
Teiran: ... I walked long enough that eventually I found a door completely filled with light. And when I walked through I just fell. <em>she shrugged</em>

Teiran: I think it would be safe to say there have been MANY humans over the past two years that have been brought there.
Thoughts: No she didn’t see anyone.
Sans looked like she may get sick: Did you ever meet any monster there that could speak?
Teiran: Never.</p>
